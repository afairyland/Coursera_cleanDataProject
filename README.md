## run_analysis.R performs the following steps and output two tables ##
 0. Read give file. 
      * both training and test dataset. 
      * subject ID file. 
      * activity file. 
      * activity ID code file.
 1. merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean an dstandard deviation for each measurement

 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names and output resulting table

 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, and output resulting table.
